Linked List
- store data non contiguous location

Array Limitations
- limited size
- insert and delete are expensive

link-list dis-advantages
- random access not allowed, need to iterate
- more memory needed to store pointer
- array provide better caching

Node : while solving problems think for all corner cases

example :
	* swap node not data
    This may look a simple problem, but is interesting question as it has following cases to be handled.
	1) x and y may or may not be adjacent.
 	2) Either x or y may be a head node.
 	3) Either x or y may be last node.
 	4) x and/or y may not be present in linked list.
