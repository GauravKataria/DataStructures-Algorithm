This repository covers : 

# Linklist
- Create Linklist
- Insert Linklist
	- at front
	- at back
	- at location
- Delete Linklist
	- given key
	- given position
- Length of Linklist
	- recursion 
	- iterative
- Swap Linklist node without changing data
- Reverse Linklist
	- recursion 
	- iterative
- MergeSorted Linklist
	- recursion 
	- iterative
- Add two number represented by LinkList
- Loop detect and removal
todo
- Reverse Linklist of given size
- MergeSort Linklist
- Rotate Linklist


# Circular Linklist
- Insert and Traverse cirular linklist
- Split circular linklist into half


# Doubly Linklist
- Insert
	- at front
	- at back
	- before
	- after
- Delete
- Reverse 
:todo
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Greatest tree-recursion 


# Stack
- Create Stack
	- using Linklist
	- using Array
- Infix to Postfix
- Evaluate Postfix
- Reverse stack recursion (t:works on:insert at bottom)
- Next greater element (t*)
- Stock Span Problem (t*)
- Impl queue using stack
- Sort stack using recursion (t:works on:sorted insert)
:todo
- Special Stack that do getMin in O(1)
- Design a stack with operations on middle element
- Implement k stacks in a single array?


# Queue
- Create Queue (t*)
- Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps (t*)
:todo
- An Interesting Method to Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to n
- Implement Stack using queue
- Priority Queue
- Deque
- Maximum of all subarrays of size k (t*)
- Implement k Queues in a single array?

# Binary Tree
- Traversal
	- Pre Order
		- recursion 
		- iterative	(*TODO)
	- In Order
		- recursion 
		- iterative (using stack)
		- iterative (without using stack, morris traversal Threaded binary tree) (*Doubt-TODO)
	- Post Order
		- recursion 
		- iterative (*TODO)
	- Level Order
		- fun to print a level
		- queue
- Diameter
	- O(n^2)
	- O(n) 			(*TODO)
- Max height of binary tree
- Max Width
- Connect node at same level
	- modified level order traversal using queue
	- connect left to right, works in complete tree
	- using extra space (getNextRight)
		- recursion 
		- iterative	
- Check tree is sub tree of some other tree
todo
- Threaded Binary tree 
- Construct tree from given two traversal
- Print node at k distance from root
- Print ancestors of given node
	- by writing function return in patterns boolean (found or found) then print
	- passing ancestor in function argument/global str (from top to bottom till found)
